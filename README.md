“Don’t let your learning lead to knowledge. Let your learning lead to action.”   Jim Rohn  This is one of my project assignments from 2021. In this assignment, I was required to build an interactive dashboard to visualize the data by showing; • Total sales. • Quantity. • Profit. • Average daily sales • Top ten products by sales and by profit.  • Average sales &amp; profit by day of the week.  This was an amazing experience for me and I loved every bit of it. #datascience #sales #analytics #businessanalyst #learning #project #data
